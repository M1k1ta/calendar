## Functionality
Users can add tasks to the calendar for each day and assign individual labels (colors) to each task or group of tasks. Additionally, they can edit the text by double-clicking on the task and change the label color by clicking on the label. Tasks are automatically deleted if the user leaves them without any text. Like in any calendar, users can track holidays. In the top left corner, there is a country selection that displays holidays for the chosen country. The calendar pagination and screen capture/save buttons, as well as filtering options, are located in the top right corner. Filtering can be done based on label color and text. Users can also drag tasks from one day to another and rearrange their order.
